# Backend Events
[Script](../../Scripting.md) notes can be triggered by events. Note that these are backend events and thus relation need to point to the "JavaScript (Trilium backend)" code note.

## Global events

Global events are attached to the script note via label. Simply create a `run` label with some of these values and script note will be executed once the event occurs.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Label</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code spellcheck="false">run</code></td>
            <td><p>Defines on which events script should run. Possible values are:</p><ul><li><code spellcheck="false">backendStartup</code> - when Trilium backend starts up</li><li><code spellcheck="false">hourly</code> - run once an hour. You can use additional label <code spellcheck="false">runAtHour</code> to specify at which hour, on the back-end.</li><li><code spellcheck="false">daily</code> - run once a day, on the back-end</li></ul></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code spellcheck="false">runOnInstance</code></td>
            <td>Specifies that the script should only run on a particular&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Configuration%20(config.ini%20or%20environment%20variables)/Trilium%20instance.md">Trilium instance</a>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code spellcheck="false">runAtHour</code></td>
            <td>On which hour should this run. Should be used together with <code spellcheck="false">#run=hourly</code>. Can be defined multiple times for more runs during the day.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Frontend scripts also have similar <a class="reference-link" href="../Frontend%20Basics/Frontend%20Events.md">Events</a>, such as when the application starts.

> [!NOTE]
> One script can be triggered on multiple events, this can be done by adding multiple `run` labels. Separating multiple values by commas **is not** supported.

## Entity events

Other events are bound to some entity, these are defined as [relations](../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.md) - meaning that script is triggered only if note has this script attached to it through relations (or it can inherit it).

| Relation | Trigger condition | Origin entity (see below) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runOnNoteCreation` | executes when note is created on backend. Use this relation if you want to run the script for all notes created under a specific subtree. In that case, create it on the subtree root note and make it inheritable. A new note created within the subtree (any depth) will trigger the script. | The `BNote` that got created. |
| `runOnChildNoteCreation` | executes when new note is created under the note where this relation is defined | The `BNote` of the child that got created. |
| `runOnNoteTitleChange` | executes when note title is changed (includes note creation as well) | The `BNote` of the note whose title got changed. |
| `runOnNoteContentChange` | executes when note content is changed (includes note creation as well). | The `BNote` of the note whose content got changed. |
| `runOnNoteChange` | executes when note is changed (includes note creation as well). Does not include content changes | The `BNote` of the note that got changed. |
| `runOnNoteDeletion` | executes when note is being deleted | The `BNote` of the note that got (soft) deleted. |
| `runOnBranchCreation` | executes when a branch is created. Branch is a link between parent note and child note and is created e.g. when cloning or moving note. | The `BBranch` that got created. |
| `runOnBranchChange` | executes when a branch is updated. (since v0.62) | The `BBranch` that got changed. |
| `runOnBranchDeletion` | executes when a branch is deleted. Branch is a link between parent note and child note and is deleted e.g. when moving note (old branch/link is deleted). | The `BBranch` that got (soft) deleted. |
| `runOnAttributeCreation` | executes when new attribute is created for the note which defines this relation | The `BAttribute` that got created. |
| `runOnAttributeChange` | executes when the attribute is changed of a note which defines this relation. This is triggered also when the attribute is deleted | The `BAttribute` that got changed. |

## Origin entity

When a script is run by an event such as the ones described above, `api.originEntity` will get populated with the note, branch or attribute that triggered the change.

For example, here's a script with `~runOnAttributeChange` which automatically changes the color of a note based on the value of the `mycategory` label:

```javascript
const attr = api.originEntity;
if (attr.name !== "mycategory") return;
const note = api.getNote(attr.noteId);
if (attr.value === "Health") {
    note.setLabel("color", "green");
} else {
    note.removeLabel("color");
}
```

## Safe mode

While [safe mode](../../Advanced%20Usage/Safe%20mode.md) is active, scripts with events won't trigger.
