/**
 * Re-running setup after a FAILED sync-from-server attempt (#10548).
 *
 * A failed initial sync leaves the database in a half-way state: the schema and the
 * seed options exist, but `initialized` is still false. The user must be able to go
 * back in the setup wizard and take ANY path again — resubmit the sync form
 * (createDatabaseForSync), or give up on syncing and create a new document instead
 * (createInitialDatabase). Both must rebuild the database from scratch (the partial
 * pull may contain rows from a *different* server) instead of failing on the
 * already-existing schema.
 *
 * Own spec file: these tests intentionally destroy and rebuild the fixture DB, and the
 * per-file fork isolation keeps that away from every other suite.
