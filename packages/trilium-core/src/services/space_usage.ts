 * Space usage reporting for the Content Manager: how much of the database each note occupies.
 *
 * All byte counting happens in a handful of grouped SQL queries — one pass over the blobs per
 * request, never a query per note. The tree walks stay on becca, which already holds the whole tree
 * in memory.
 *
 * A cloned note lives in several places but occupies space once, so every note is counted at exactly
 * one **canonical placement**: the parent through which it is first reached by a breadth-first walk
 * from the root that enters the hidden subtree last. Reachable outside the hidden subtree means the
 * note is part of the user's visible tree; everything else — launchers, options, orphans — is
 * aggregated into a "hidden" bucket rather than listed note by note.
 *
 * Sizes are `LENGTH(blobs.content)` like the existing per-note stats endpoints, so the numbers match
 * what the note info widget already shows. Blobs shared between entities through deduplication are
 * counted at each entity, so per-note numbers stay meaningful; the reclaimable aggregates — deleted
 * notes and unused attachments — are the exception, counting only blobs nothing else would keep
 * alive, i.e. what erasing would really free.

 * keeps every snapshot doomed — the same figure as before they existed, and the one to report when
 * nothing narrower was asked for.
 *
 * An estimate rather than a promise, because the limit it answers for is one number across every
 * note, while the operation follows each note's own `#versioningLimit` wherever one is set — a label
 * outranks the limit asked for here, being a policy set on that note deliberately. A note labelled
 * to keep more than the stated limit therefore frees less than its share of this figure, so the
