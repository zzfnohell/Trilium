 * Cached sector hashes together with the entity_changes fingerprint they were computed at.
 *
 * Every write to entity_changes moves the fingerprint: updates go through a REPLACE that assigns a
 * fresh autoincrement id (raising MAX(id)) and deletions lower COUNT(*), so `(count, maxId)`
 * changing is a reliable "something changed" signal regardless of which code path wrote. No current
 * code path flips a row's isSynced flag in place (that too goes through REPLACE), but since the
 * hash computation filters on isSynced, the fingerprint also tracks the synced-row count as cheap
 * insurance against such a writer ever appearing. The check runs at the end of every sync cycle of
 * every connected client (every ~60 s), and in the common idle case nothing has changed — the
 * cache turns a full scan-and-hash of entity_changes (plus the unused-blob sweep) into a single
 * index-only query. Cache hits are deliberately not logged (they would fire every cycle for every
 * client); a check without a "Content hash computation took" log line was served from cache.
