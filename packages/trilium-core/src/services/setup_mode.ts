 * Setup asked for by an instance that already has a database.

 * user can ask for, restoring a backup among them, need the same screen and the same closed
 * database, so a running instance writes a `setup.json` marker and restarts. The start that follows
 * reads it, hands it to this module, and from then on the instance answers "not initialized" to
 * everything that asks: the database is never migrated, becca is never loaded, the desktop opens its
 * setup window, and every guard that exists to protect an uninitialized instance keeps working
 * unchanged.
 *
 * The state lives for the process, not for the file, which is read once and deleted. A page reloaded
 * halfway through the wizard therefore comes back to the same screen, while a genuine restart comes
 * back to the app.
