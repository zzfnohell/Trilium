# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable minor release receives security fixes.

For example, if the latest stable version is 0.92.3 and the latest beta is 0.93.0-beta, then only the 0.92.x line will receive security patches. Older versions (like 0.91.x) will not receive fixes.

This policy may be altered on a case-by-case basis for critical vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please report all security vulnerabilities through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/security/advisories/new).**

We do not accept security reports via email, public issues, or other channels. GitHub Security Advisories allows us to:
- Discuss and triage vulnerabilities privately
- Coordinate fixes before public disclosure
- Credit reporters appropriately
- Publish advisories with CVE identifiers

### What to Include

When reporting, please provide:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Affected versions (if known)
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 7 days
- **Triage decision**: Within 14 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

## Scope

### In Scope

- Remote code execution
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) that affects other users
- SQL injection
- Path traversal
- Sensitive data exposure
- Privilege escalation

### Out of Scope (Won't Fix)

The following are considered out of scope or accepted risks:

#### Self-XSS / Self-Injection
Trilium is a personal knowledge base where users have full control over their own data. Users can intentionally create notes containing scripts, HTML, or other executable content. This is by design - Trilium's scripting system allows users to extend functionality with custom JavaScript.

Vulnerabilities that require a user to inject malicious content into their own notes and then view it themselves are not considered security issues.

#### Published (Shared) Note Content
A shared note is published by its owner, and the share view renders it as it was authored, raw HTML included. Script running on a page you publish is not an escalation of anything: Trilium supports it deliberately, through the `~shareJs` relation, which loads a JavaScript note of your choosing into the share page, and through `~shareTemplate` for the page around it.

Reports that reduce to "a note's own HTML or JavaScript executes for visitors to the page publishing it" are therefore out of scope, however the content was written (editor, ETAPI, sync). Content arriving through the importers and the web clipper is sanitized on write, independently of this.

What crosses out of the published page remains **in scope**: disclosing notes that were never shared, bypassing `#shareCredentials` or `#shareHiddenFromTree`, or reaching the authenticated session of someone who merely visited. So does a defect in how the share renderer itself builds markup, such as a value escaping the attribute it was placed in; we fix those as correctness bugs even where the value was the publisher's own.

#### Electron Architecture
The desktop application follows the Electron security checklist: `nodeIntegration` is disabled, `contextIsolation` is enabled, and the renderer can only reach the main process through a whitelisted `contextBridge` API (`window.electronApi`). Embedded web content (Web View notes) is isolated in a dedicated session partition with deny-by-default permission handlers, `<webview>` attach requests are vetted in the main process, and window-open/navigation requests are checked against a scheme allowlist. Electron fuses additionally prevent external abuse.

User scripting (see Self-XSS above) still intentionally allows arbitrary JavaScript in the renderer, so reports that reduce to "a user script can call the frontend API" remain out of scope. Renderer-to-main escapes, however, **are in scope**: gaining Node.js access from the renderer, bypassing the preload bridge whitelist, or escaping the webview isolation.

#### Authenticated User Actions
Actions that require valid authentication and only affect the authenticated user's own data are generally not vulnerabilities.

#### Private Addresses Reached by a Configured LLM Endpoint
Outbound requests the server makes on behalf of note content — link previews, image fetches, imports — are vetted against a strict rule: the hostname is resolved, every address behind it must be a public unicast one, and the connection is pinned to the addresses actually checked. Note content is not entitled to the network its host can see.

An LLM provider's base URL is not note content, and the same rule cannot apply to it. Running a model locally is the reason several of the providers exist: Ollama and LM Studio both default to `localhost`, and either is as likely to be another machine on the LAN. A server that refused those addresses would not be a safer Trilium, it would be one where local models do not work at all. So for that destination — and only that one — loopback, RFC1918 and unique-local addresses are deliberately permitted.

Reports that reduce to "an authenticated user can point the LLM base URL at a host on the local network, and the server connects to it" are therefore out of scope, including the reachability and port information that connecting necessarily reveals.

What stays refused is what no model server is ever served on: link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`, which is where a cloud instance answers with its own credentials) and carrier-grade NAT (`100.64.0.0/10`, likewise). Redirects are not followed on these requests at all, since the hop would carry the configured API key to whoever the endpoint named. Defects in **those** guards are in scope, as is any path that reaches them without authentication.

#### Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion
Creating extremely large notes or performing many operations is expected user behavior in a note-taking application.

#### Missing Security Headers on Non-Sensitive Endpoints
We implement security headers where they provide meaningful protection, but may omit them on endpoints where they provide no practical benefit.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Report received** - We acknowledge receipt and begin triage
2. **Fix developed** - We develop and test a fix privately
3. **Release prepared** - Security release is prepared with vague changelog
4. **Users notified** - Release is published, users encouraged to upgrade
5. **Advisory published** - After reasonable upgrade window (typically 2-4 weeks), full advisory is published

We appreciate reporters allowing us time to fix issues before public disclosure. We aim to credit all reporters in published advisories unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Updates

Security fixes are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.92.1 → 0.92.2) to minimize upgrade friction. We recommend all users keep their installations up to date.
