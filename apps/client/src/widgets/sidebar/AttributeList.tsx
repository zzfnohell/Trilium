/**
 * The note's attributes as a list, one row per attribute: the kind (label, relation, or either's
 * definition) is carried by an icon instead of by the `#`/`~`/`label:` syntax the attributes editor
 * spells out, and the value is shown as a preview rather than in full. Rows open the same detail
 * form the editor uses, which is where an attribute is actually edited — except an owned attribute's
 * value, the edit that is made again and again: a label's is edited in place by pressing the preview
 * itself, through the field its definition calls for, and a relation's target is repicked from the
 * pencil on its row, the value staying the link it is (see {@link AttributeValueEditor}).
 *
 * The form floats beside its row where there is room for it — a panel with a note's width beside it —
 * and is a page of its own inside a master-detail host (a modal on a phone), which slides it in over
 * the list and heads it with a way back.
