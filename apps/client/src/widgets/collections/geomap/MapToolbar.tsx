/**
 * The controls standing in the corner of a geo map: how close in the map is drawn, and how much of
 * the screen it is given.
 *
 * MapLibre offers bars of its own for both (`NavigationControl`, which is what stood here, and
 * `FullscreenControl`), dressed in neither Trilium's buttons nor Trilium's colors — a white box with
 * hairline-separated squares in it, on a map that may well be dark. What they do is done here
 * instead, on the {@link OverlayControlGroup} the image viewer's zoom buttons stand on (see
 * {@link ImageViewer}). No readout between the steps, though: a map's zoom level is a number
 * out of the cartographer's toolbox, not the reader's, and a map has no fitted view a readout
 * could offer back the way an image has.
 *
 * In the foot corner, where every other set of zoom controls floating over content in the app
 * stands, rather than in the top corner MapLibre keeps its own zoom buttons in. The corner is the
 * map's to give: its attribution has been moved to the foot of the other side, beside the scale
 * (see map.tsx).
 *
 * At the group's leading end stands the tilt, after Google Maps's own button: 3D leans the view
 * over, 2D lays it flat again. Which of the two it offers is read off the view itself rather than
 * remembered from the last press — MapLibre tilts for Ctrl and a drag as well, and a button that
 * only watched itself would go on offering a 3D the reader is already in.
 *
 * On mobile the two steps stay home, as the image viewer's do: the fingers already zoom, and the
 * foot of a narrow map is spoken for. The tilt is kept — the two-finger drag that leans the view
 * is told to nobody, so the button is the one visible way into 3D — and so is the screen, which a
 * small one has the most to gain from.
 */

/** How far the button leans the view over — a lean rather than the horizon, as Google Maps takes
