 * The editing actions, standing in the middle of the map's foot on an {@link OverlayControlGroup} of
 * their own — the surface every group over this map stands on: adding a marker and bringing in a GPX
 * track today, with room along the row for whatever editing the map comes to offer next.
 *
 * A group of its own rather than more buttons on {@link MapToolbar}: that one is the camera — how
 * close in the map is drawn, how much screen it gets — and what changes the map is another kind of
 * thing. The middle of the foot is the stretch left free, the corners being spoken for: the scale
 * and the attribution lead, the camera group trails, and the detail pane holds the trailing edge.
 *
 * Adding a marker is the one thing a collection map is for, so the + carries its name in words
 * rather than standing as a bare glyph — and while the map is armed, the words say what a second
 * press does. It stands on the map rather than in the collection bar above it because the map alone
 * is what goes fullscreen (see MapToolbar): the collection bar stays behind, and while the button
 * lived there, a fullscreen map could only be added to through its right-click menu.
