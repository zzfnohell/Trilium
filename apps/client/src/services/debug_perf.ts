/**
 * Opt-in main-thread instrumentation for tracking down UI stalls.
 *
 * Recording is off by default and every entry point costs one boolean check when off, so call
 * sites can sit in hot paths (per-card renders, per-cell formatting) without being paid for in
 * normal use. Drive it from the devtools console:
 *
 * ```js
 * triliumPerf.enable();     // start recording; also logs every long task as it happens
 * triliumPerf.report();     // print what has been gathered so far
 * triliumPerf.reset();      // clear the counters, keep recording
 * triliumPerf.disable();
 * triliumPerf.components(); // census the widget tree, for hunting leaked widgets
 * ```
 *
 * Spans additionally land on the User Timing track via `performance.measure()`, so a DevTools
 * performance capture shows them lined up against the long tasks they explain.
 *
 * Nothing calls into this by default, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight: instrument
 * whatever is being investigated for as long as it takes to answer the question, then take the call
 * sites back out. Adding the first `perfSpan()` or `perfCount()` anywhere is what pulls this module
 * into the bundle, which is also what puts `triliumPerf` on `window` -- so there is nothing to arm
 * beyond the call site itself.
