/**
 * The server's Node-only contributions to the LLM stack.
 *
 * The stack itself lives in `@triliumnext/core`, so the browser-hosted
 * (standalone) build can run it too. What could not follow it there is anything
 * that needs Node: the providers that spawn the Claude Code and GitHub Copilot
 * CLIs, and the User Guide tools, which read pages off disk. Core exposes a seam
 * for each; this is where the server fills them in — including the skill sheets,
 * whose catalog is core's while the reading is per-runtime.
 *
 * Each seam is keyed rather than bespoke, so the next host-provided provider is
 * one more line here and one more entry in core's HOST_PROVIDED_TYPES.
