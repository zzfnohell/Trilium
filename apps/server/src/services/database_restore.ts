 * simply be written over: the connection is detached, the file is exchanged, and a new connection is
 * attached to what is now there. On Windows that order is not a preference — an open handle prevents
 * the file from being renamed at all.
 *
 * Everything that can be checked is checked before the exchange, on a copy nothing is attached to,
 * because the alternative is finding out afterwards: the migration is what would otherwise notice an
 * unusable database, and a migration that cannot proceed ends the process outright.
 *
 * The database being replaced is kept aside until the restored one has migrated and opened. Until
 * then a marker sits next to it, so an interruption in the middle — a power cut, a killed process —
 * is recognised at the next start and undone, rather than leaving an instance that cannot open its
 * own document.
 *
 * Only ever run during setup, where nothing else holds the database: the share connection is opened
 * on `dbReady`, which has not resolved, and sessions are not persisted until the database is
 * initialized.
