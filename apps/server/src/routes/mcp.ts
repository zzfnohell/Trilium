/**
 * Caps failed authentications per IP — token guessing is unbounded once the endpoint is
 * reachable off-loopback. Mirrors the login limiter.
 *
 * A request costs budget only if it is one the guard behind this would answer 401 to, and
 * the cost is never refunded: `skip` decides before anything is recorded. The refund route
 * that express-rate-limit offers for the same goal — `skipSuccessfulRequests`, which
 * records the hit up front and gives it back from a `res.on("finish")` handler — cannot be
 * used here, because a response that never finishes never gets its hit back. Abandoned
 * responses are routine on this endpoint: an MCP client drops its standing `GET /mcp` event
 * stream on every reconnect, and cancels in-flight tool calls on timeout or user interrupt.
 * Ten of those inside the window — a handful of agent restarts — and the limiter answers
 * 429 to a perfectly valid token for the rest of it, which reads to the user as the MCP
 * connection dropping.
 *
 * A 401 always completes, so nothing is abandoned on the path that does spend budget.
 *
 * The corollary is that a valid token is served even from an address that has exhausted its
 * budget. That is the intent, not a hole: the budget is per-IP, and a Docker port mapping,
 * a NAT or a reverse proxy collapses every client onto one address, so anything else lets
 * one bad client lock out the one that actually holds a credential. Guessing is still
 * throttled — that is what the budget is for — and throttling a request that already
 * presents the right token protects nothing.

/**
 * Pure access decision for {@link mcpGuard}, extracted so the branching is unit-testable.
 *
 * An ETAPI token is required unconditionally — loopback is *not* a credential. Any local
 * process (a package postinstall script, another user on a shared box) can reach the
 * loopback listener, so the previous "no token needed from 127.0.0.1" rule handed full
 * read/write access over every note to anything running on the machine. It also meant a
 * misconfigured `trustedReverseProxy` could forge `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` and walk
 * straight in. This mirrors what the web clipper already does on the server build
 * (see routes.ts — `clipperMiddleware`).
 *
 * Requiring the token also makes the SDK's DNS-rebinding protection redundant rather than
 * merely inconvenient: rebinding attacks work by borrowing the victim browser's *network
 * position*, and a bearer token is not ambient authority — cross-origin JS cannot attach an
 * `Authorization` header without a CORS preflight we never approve. See
 * {@link handleMcpRequest} for why the Host allow-list is therefore gone.
 *
 * Note the 401 deliberately carries no `WWW-Authenticate` header. In MCP that header is
 * the OAuth-discovery trigger (RFC 9728) and must point at protected-resource metadata;
 * Trilium has no authorization server, so advertising one would send spec-compliant
 * clients into a discovery flow that cannot succeed.
