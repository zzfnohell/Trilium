# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Trilium Notes is a hierarchical note-taking application with synchronization, scripting, and rich text editing. TypeScript monorepo using pnpm with multiple apps and shared packages.

## Development Commands

- **Never run ESLint** (`dev:linter-check`, `dev:linter-fix`, `npx eslint`) — it dies with an out-of-memory error, so a run tells you nothing. CI does not lint either — there is no `eslint`/`linter-check` step anywhere in `.github/workflows/`, so lint findings never block a merge; the gates are `pnpm typecheck` and the per-package `test --coverage` runs. (`packages/*` is ignored by the ESLint config anyway.)
- **Never run `pnpm test:all`, `test:parallel`, `test:sequential`, or a whole-package `coverage`** during development — CI runs them on every push. Run the **narrowest** suite that covers what you touched: `pnpm --filter <pkg> test <pattern>` (Vitest treats the trailing argument as a substring filter over spec paths). Core specs need **two** runs, server and standalone (see Testing). Only reach for a full suite if the user asks or wants a final check.
- **Typecheck with `pnpm typecheck`, not a raw `tsc`** — it resolves the project references a hand-written `tsc -p …` gets wrong, and is far cheaper than a test suite. Still, run it **once, after a piece of work is finished** — not after every edit: it builds the project references, and repeating it is a common way to lose minutes across a session.
- **Two TypeScript versions, on purpose**: root `package.json` has `typescript` 6.x (the JS compiler API that TypeDoc, typescript-eslint and the browser-bundled language service in `packages/codemirror` load) and `@typescript/native` (7, drives `pnpm typecheck` and owns the `tsc` bin). Do **not** bump `typescript` to 7, dedupe them, or switch to the `@typescript/typescript6` shim (no `lib.*.d.ts` → client build breaks). Reasoning: `docs/Developer Guide/Developer Guide/Environment Setup.md`, "TypeScript".

## Git Workflow

- **Committing directly on `main` is allowed and expected** for small fixes and self-contained features — do **not** create a branch first for those. The default "branch before committing on the default branch" rule does not apply to this repository.
- **Large or risky work goes on a branch**: multi-commit features, migrations, refactors spanning many packages, anything that needs review or a PR before landing.
- Only commit when explicitly asked to **in that message**, and the ask covers only the step it accompanies — a later step is left uncommitted until asked again. A remark like "commits go on main" is about branch choice, not standing permission to commit. Otherwise leave changes staged/unstaged for review.
- **The issue-closing keyword goes in the commit/PR subject**, not the body — `fix(markdown): wrap imported tables (closes #10270)`.
- **`git rm` is not a neutral delete.** It leaves the deletion staged, so a commit made before the matching reference updates are staged lands a `HEAD` pointing at a module that no longer exists. When removing a file whose references are edited in the same pass, delete it from the filesystem instead, or land the deletion and the reference updates together — never leave the index in a state that is broken on its own.

## Monorepo Structure

`pnpm --filter <package> <command>` runs a command in one package.

**`packages/trilium-core` is shared by server, desktop and standalone — *not* by the client.** `apps/client` has zero `@triliumnext/core` imports; it reaches the backend over REST/WebSocket and shares only **types** via `@triliumnext/commons`. So: a dependency added to core lands in server, desktop and standalone bundles (standalone's worker imports core at startup — that is the cost to weigh, never "the client would pay for it"), and frontend code can never call a core function — it needs an API route or a type in commons. The split is backend-vs-frontend, not Node-vs-browser: standalone runs core in a browser worker, which is why core carries the no-Node-built-ins rules below.

## Core Architecture

### Three-Layer Cache System

All data access goes through cache layers — never bypass with direct DB queries:

- **Becca** (`packages/trilium-core/src/becca/`): Server-side entity cache. Access via `becca.notes[noteId]`.
- **Froca** (`apps/client/src/services/froca.ts`): Client-side mirror synced via WebSocket. Access via `froca.getNote()`.
- **Shaca** (`apps/server/src/share/`): Optimized cache for shared/published notes.

**Critical**: Always use cache methods, not direct DB writes. Cache methods create `EntityChange` records needed for synchronization.

### Entity System

Core entities live in `packages/trilium-core/src/becca/entities/` (not `apps/server/`):

- `BNote` — Notes with content and metadata
- `BBranch` — Multi-parent tree relationships (cloning supported)
- `BAttribute` — Key-value metadata (labels and relations)
- `BRevision` — Version history
- `BOption` — Application configuration
- `BBlob` — Binary content storage

Entities extend `AbstractBeccaEntity<T>` with built-in change tracking, hash generation, and date management.

### Entity Change & Sync Protocol

Every entity modification creates an `EntityChange` record driving sync:
1. Login with HMAC authentication (document secret + timestamp)
2. Push changes → Pull changes → Push again (conflict resolution)
3. Content hash verification with retry loop

Sync services: `packages/trilium-core/src/services/sync.ts`, `syncMutexService`, `syncUpdateService`.

### Widget-Based UI

Frontend widgets in `apps/client/src/widgets/`:
- `BasicWidget` / `TypedBasicWidget` — Base classes (jQuery `this.$widget` for DOM)
- `NoteContextAwareWidget` — Responds to note changes
- `RightPanelWidget` — Sidebar widgets with position ordering
- Type-specific widgets in `type_widgets/` directory

**Widget lifecycle**: `doRenderBody()` for initial render, `refreshWithNote()` for note changes, `entitiesReloadedEvent({loadResults})` for entity updates. Fluent builder pattern: `.child()`, `.class()`, `.css()` chaining with position-based ordering. These legacy widgets are jQuery; new UI is Preact under `widgets/react/` — don't mix the two inside one component.

#### Reusable Preact Components
Shared components live in `apps/client/src/widgets/react/` — **always** reuse them (`FormTextBox`, `FormSelect`, `Button`, `Badge`, `NoItems`, `Dropdown`, `Table`, `Calendar`, …) instead of writing raw HTML elements or a custom implementation, and never put Bootstrap utility classes (`form-control-sm`, `input-group`, …) on them. Any control floating **over** a note's content (map, mind map, image, diagram) goes on `OverlayControlGroup` / `OverlayToolbar` — never a hand-rolled `<button>`. The full catalogue, the `Dropdown` backdrop-blur rules (`noDropdownListStyle` / `portalToBody`) and the overlay-control contract are in the **`building-client-ui` skill** — load it before building client UI.

#### Component Styling
- **Avoid inline styles** — do not use the `style` attribute/prop on JSX elements unless absolutely necessary (e.g. a truly dynamic, computed value that cannot be expressed in CSS). Static layout, sizing, spacing, and visual properties must go in CSS.
- **Per-component CSS files**: each component should have a matching `.css` file (e.g. `my_dialog.tsx` → `my_dialog.css`), imported at the top of the component file.
- **CSS nesting for scoping**: since CSS modules are not available, scope styles using a root class and native CSS nesting. For example, a dialog with `className="my-dialog"` should have its styles nested under `.modal.my-dialog { … }`.
- **Reuse existing components** instead of building custom markup — prefer `FormTextBox`, `FormTextBoxWithUnit`, `FormSelect`, `Slider`, `Button`, etc. over hand-rolled `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<button>` elements.

### API Architecture

- **Internal API** — REST, trusts the frontend. Most routes are core-shared and also run under WASM (`packages/trilium-core/src/routes/`); Node-only ones live in `apps/server/src/routes/api/`. Load the **`adding-internal-api-route` skill** for the wrapper/return conventions before adding one.
- **ETAPI** (`apps/server/src/etapi/`) — external API with token auth; keep it backwards compatible.
- **WebSocket** (`packages/trilium-core/src/services/ws.ts`) — real-time sync to the client (IPC-backed on desktop).

### Platform Abstraction and core rules

`packages/trilium-core/src/services/platform.ts` defines `PlatformProvider` (`crash()`, `getEnv()`, `isElectron`/`isMac`/`isWindows`), implemented per app in `apps/desktop`, `apps/server`, `apps/standalone`; singleton via `initPlatform()`/`getPlatform()`. Because core also runs in standalone's browser worker:

- **No `process.env`** — `getPlatform().getEnv(key)` (standalone maps URL params like `?safeMode` → `TRILIUM_SAFE_MODE`).
- **No Node built-ins** in core, including `path` — use `packages/trilium-core/src/services/utils/path.ts` (`extname()`/`basename()`) and the platform providers.
- **Platform checks are functions** — `isElectron()`, `isMac()`, `isWindows()` from `utils/index.ts` call `getPlatform()` and only work after `initializeCore()`; in static definitions wrap them in a closure (`value: () => isWindows() ? "0.9" : "1.0"`).
- **Avoid the barrel** in early-loading modules — `import { x } from "@triliumnext/core"` loads every export; `config.ts`-like modules import subpaths (`@triliumnext/core/src/services/utils/index`) to dodge init-order cycles.
- **Binary conversions** go through `packages/trilium-core/src/services/utils/binary.ts` (`wrapStringOrBuffer`/`unwrapStringOrBuffer` for `string | Uint8Array`, `encodeBase64`/`decodeBase64`, `encodeUtf8`/`decodeUtf8`; also exported as `binary_utils`), not hand-rolled `TextEncoder`/`Buffer.from()`.

### Electron Desktop App
`apps/desktop` runs server + client in one Electron process; the renderer loads over the `trilium-app://` custom protocol and talks to main only through the preload bridge (`window.electronApi`, typed by `packages/commons/src/lib/electron_api_interface.ts`). `nodeIntegration` is off, `contextIsolation` is on, `@electron/remote` is gone — never `require("electron")` in client code. Adding an API means interface + `preload.ts` + an `ipcMain` handler in the owning service + a spec. Load the **`developing-electron-desktop` skill** for the recipe, the security model, running/launch errors and testing.

### Standalone (in-browser) app
`apps/standalone` runs the client on the page and `@triliumnext/core` — plain JS — in a dedicated Web Worker over `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` persisted in OPFS; a Web Lock elects the one tab that owns the database and the service worker forwards other tabs' API calls to it. Every core provider has a browser twin in `apps/standalone/src/lightweight/` — **a new provider or Node import in core breaks this build first.** Load the **`developing-standalone` skill** before touching `sw.ts`, `main.ts`, `local-server-worker.ts`, `lightweight/*` or `vite.config.mts`.

### Mobile (Capacitor) app
`apps/mobile` wraps the standalone WASM build in a Capacitor WebView — no network backend. Android runs at `https://localhost` and routes API calls through the service worker; iOS runs at `capacitor://localhost`, where no service worker can register, so `apps/standalone/src/ios-interceptors.ts` stands in. **`iosScheme: "https"` is a no-op and must not be re-added, and the iOS interceptor path is not dead code.** Load the **`developing-capacitor-mobile` skill** before touching `apps/mobile`, `ios-interceptors.ts`, `capacitor_http_handler.ts` or the `capacitor:` branches of `sw.ts`/`main.ts`.

### Database

SQLite (`better-sqlite3` on Node, `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` on OPFS in standalone) behind `packages/trilium-core/src/services/sql/` (`DatabaseProvider`, prepared-statement cache, transactions). Schema: `packages/trilium-core/src/assets/schema.sql`; migrations: integer-versioned entries in the descending `MIGRATIONS` array in `packages/trilium-core/src/migrations/migrations.ts` (inline SQL or a `NNNN__description.ts` module) — load the **`evolving-the-data-model` skill** before adding a column or migration.

### Internationalization

- English is the only catalogue you edit; 40+ other locales come from Weblate. Three English catalogues, chosen by who loads the string: `apps/client/src/translations/en/translation.json` (the app), `en/entry.json` (`setup.*`, `login.*`, `set_password.*` — the setup/login/password pages load only this ~11 KB file), and `apps/server/src/assets/translations/en/server.json` (server, `trilium-core`, the Electron main process **and** standalone's worker — it is the catalogue for every non-browser-UI runtime, so a `t()` in core needs no fallback). Load the **`working-with-translations` skill** to find, add or audit keys without reading the 226 KB file.
- Client: `import { t } from "../services/i18n"`; everywhere else: `import { t } from "i18next"`. Never hardcode user-facing text, including in Electron dialogs/tray/IPC.
- `{{var}}` interpolates escaped; `{{- var}}` unescaped (values with quotes etc.). Interpolated **components** whose order can vary by language (links, note references) use `<Trans>` from `react-i18next`, not `t()`.
- Third-party components (mind-map context menu, …) still go through `t()` with their strings under a dedicated namespace (e.g. `"mind-map"`).
- **Text editor (`packages/ckeditor5`)**: plugins call `editor.t("English text")` — the English text *is* the message id, the entry lives under `text-editor.ck` keyed by its slug, and `apps/client/src/services/i18n.spec.ts` fails on a missing or stale one. Rules (name it `t`, literal argument, don't shadow upstream strings, `MESSAGE_OVERRIDES`, `renderShortcut`): **`ckeditor5-plugin-development` skill**.
- New locale: `docs/Developer Guide/Developer Guide/Concepts/Internationalisation  Translations/Adding a new locale.md`.

### Attribute Inheritance

Three inheritance mechanisms:
1. **Standard**: `note.getInheritableAttributes()` walks parent tree
2. **Child prefix**: `child:label` on parent copies to children
3. **Template relation**: `#template=noteNoteId` includes template's inheritable attributes

Use `note.getOwnedAttribute()` for direct, `note.getAttribute()` for inherited.

### Client-Side API Restrictions
- **Do not use `crypto.randomUUID()`** or other Web Crypto APIs that require secure contexts - Trilium can run over HTTP, not just HTTPS
- Use `randomString()` from `apps/client/src/services/utils.ts` for generating IDs instead

### Shared Types Policy
- Types shared between client and server belong in `@triliumnext/commons` (`packages/commons/src/lib/`)
- Import shared types directly from `@triliumnext/commons` - do not re-export them from app-specific modules
- Keep app-specific types (e.g., `LlmProvider` for server, `StreamCallbacks` for client) in their respective apps

## Important Patterns

- **Protected notes**: Check `note.isContentAvailable()` before accessing content; use `note.getTitleOrProtected()` for safe title access
- **Long operations**: Use `TaskContext` for progress reporting via WebSocket
- **Event system** (`packages/trilium-core/src/services/events.ts`): Events emitted in order (notes → branches → attributes) during load for referential integrity
- **Search**: Expression-based, scoring happens in-memory — cannot add SQL-level LIMIT/OFFSET without losing scoring
- **Widget cleanup**: Unsubscribe from events in `cleanup()`/`doDestroy()` to prevent memory leaks

## Code Style

- Imports sorted per `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` (packages before relative, alphabetical within a group) — only ESLint checks that and it isn't run locally, so sort by hand.
- **Never use the non-null assertion `!`**, tests included. Narrow instead: `?.`, `?? fallback`, an explicit check, or an `*OrThrow` accessor (`becca.getNoteOrThrow(id)`).
- **Never use `Array.prototype.forEach`** — write a `for...of` loop instead, and iterate `array.entries()` when the index is needed (`for (const [index, item] of arr.entries())`). It reads better and allows `break`/`continue`/`await`.
- **Helpers go below the primary export** they support (or in another module), never between the imports and the main definition — the entry point reads first.
- **No ~10-SLOC modules.** A component, hook or helper of about ten lines of substance joins an existing module that owns the same concept (e.g. `OverlayFullscreenButton` lives in `OverlayControlGroup.tsx`, its tests in that spec); a file of its own costs a module boundary and an import per call site and buys nothing. Split out once it has grown.
- **Comments** — Google developer-documentation style: plain English, present tense, active voice, real identifiers (`froca.getNote()`, not "the cache lookup"); *can*/*might*/*must* used precisely, never *may*. Say what the code does or why it is shaped so, not what changed. Keep it to a line or two — the reproduction, the measurements and the before/after belong in the commit body, which is the place to be thorough. A comment narrating a defect ("at 375px those ran 28px past the card") ages the moment the layout moves, and the next reader needs only the constraint that still binds, not the investigation.
- **CSS comments** never narrate a change (`/* was 8px */`, `/* moved from the toolbar */`) — that is the commit message. Comment only what is non-obvious in place: a browser workaround, a value that must match one elsewhere, a `z-index` in a stacking contract.

## Testing

- **Server tests** (`apps/server/spec/`): Vitest, must run sequentially (shared DB), forks pool, max 6 workers
- **Client tests** (`apps/client/src/`): Vitest with happy-dom environment, can run in parallel
- **Core tests** (`packages/trilium-core/src/**/*.spec.ts`): `trilium-core` has no runner of its own — the **server and standalone suites both include** its specs (`apps/server/vite.config.mts`, `apps/standalone/vite.config.mts`) and run them against different platform providers (node + better-sqlite3 vs. happy-dom + sqlite-wasm). Green under `pnpm --filter server test` is **not** proof; run `pnpm --filter standalone test` as well. See the `writing-unit-tests` skill for the cross-runtime traps
- **E2E tests** (`packages/trilium-e2e/`): Shared Playwright tests, run via `pnpm --filter server e2e` or `pnpm --filter standalone e2e`
- **ETAPI tests** (`apps/server/spec/etapi/`): External API contract tests
- **Browser-mode tests** (`packages/ckeditor5`) drive a real headless Chrome via `@vitest/browser-webdriverio`; where its downloaded Chrome cannot run (NixOS), point `CHROME_BIN`/`CHROMEDRIVER_PATH` at a matching system pair — never start a chromedriver by hand or add a local override config. See the `ckeditor5-testing` skill
- **Build validation tests** check artifact integrity
- **Write concise tests**: Group related assertions together in a single test case rather than creating many one-shot tests
- **Extract and test business logic**: When adding pure business logic (e.g., data transformations, migrations, validations), extract it as a separate function and always write unit tests for it

## Documentation

- Script API reference — Generated by `apps/build-docs` (TypeDoc) into the gitignored `site/script-api/{backend,frontend,electron}` and published to [docs.triliumnotes.org](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/). Not committed; never hand-edit — it's regenerated from the script API type definitions
- `docs/User Guide/` — Edit via `pnpm edit-docs:edit-docs`, not manually
- `docs/Developer Guide/` and `docs/Release Notes/` — Safe for direct Markdown editing

### Always check the docs against a user-visible change

Any change to what the user sees or does — a button moved or removed, a keyboard shortcut, a label, an
option, a default, where a feature is configured — **can leave the User Guide describing an affordance
that no longer exists**. Before reporting the work done, grep `docs/User Guide/` for the feature and for
the control you touched (its name, its icon, the panel it lived in) and read every hit. Report what needs
updating as part of the change, without waiting to be asked; the docs are a deliverable, not a follow-up.

Two traps this catches:

- **The doc named the wrong place to begin with.** Verify where a control actually mounts by grepping for
  the component, not by inferring it from an i18n namespace or from another doc page — `NoteBadges` is
  keyed `breadcrumb_badges.*` and renders in the title row.
- **A capability gate has a blast radius.** Widening one (a note type added to a list a widget switches
  on) can surface panels, bars and menu entries the change never mentioned. Grep the gate's other readers
  and say what else now appears.

## Recipes

### Storing User Preferences
**No `localStorage`** — preferences are synced options. Follow the **`creating-a-new-option` skill** (details: `docs/Developer Guide/Developer Guide/Concepts/Options/Creating a new option.md`).

### Adding Hidden System Notes
Follow the **`adding-hidden-system-notes` skill**.

### Writing to Notes from Server Services
- `note.setContent()` requires a CLS (Continuation Local Storage) context — wrap calls in `cls.init(() => { ... })` (from `packages/trilium-core/src/services/context.ts`)
- Operations called from Express routes already have CLS context; standalone services (schedulers, Electron IPC handlers) do not

### Adding New LLM Tools
Follow the **`adding-llm-mcp-tools` skill** (registries, the synchronous-`execute` contract, registration, client labels).

### Server-Side Static Assets
Node-side assets (templates, translations, prompts) live in `apps/server/src/assets/` and are read via `RESOURCE_DIR` from `apps/server/src/services/resource_dir.ts` (`path.join(RESOURCE_DIR, "llm", "prompts", …)`); assets core itself reads (`schema.sql`, LLM skills) live in `packages/trilium-core/src/assets/`. **Never resolve paths with `import.meta.url`/`fileURLToPath` or `__dirname` + relative path** — the server is bundled to CJS and both point at the bundle, not the source tree.

## MCP Server

Trilium exposes an MCP server at `http://localhost:8080/mcp` (`.mcp.json`) — only while `pnpm server:start` is running, and only with an ETAPI token exported as `TRILIUM_ETAPI_TOKEN` before starting Claude Code (otherwise `401`; create one in Options → ETAPI). Use it to read/search/modify real note data when developing note-related features.
